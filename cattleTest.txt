Cattle
colloquially
cows
the
most
common
type
of
large
domesticated
ungulates
They
are
a
prominent
modern
member
of
the
subfamily
Bovinae
are
the
most
widespread
species
of
the
genus
Bos
and
are
most
commonly
classified
collectively
as
Bos
taurus
Cattle
are
raised
as
livestock
for
meat
(beef
and
veal),
as
dairy
animals
for
milk
and
other
dairy
products,
and
as
draft
animals
(oxen
or
bullocks)
(pulling
carts,
plows
and
other
implements).
Other
products
include
leather
and
dung
for
manure
or
fuel.
In
some
regions,
such
as
parts
of
India,
cattle
have
significant
religious
meaning.
From
as
few
as
progenitors
domesticated
in
southeast
Turkey
about
years
ago,
according
to
an
estimate
from
there
are
billion
cattle
in
the
world.
In
cattle
became
the
first
livestock
animal
to
have
a
fully
mapped
genome.

Cattle
were
originally
identified
as
three
separate
species:
Bos
taurus,
the
European
or
"taurine"
cattle
(including
similar
types
from
Africa
and
Asia);
Bos
indicus,
the
zebu;
and
the
extinct
Bos
primigenius,
the
aurochs.
The
aurochs
is
ancestral
to
both
zebu
and
taurine
cattle.
Now,
these
have
been
reclassified
as
one
species,
with
Bos
taurus
primigenius
and
Bos
taurus
indicus.
Complicating
the
matter
is
the
ability
of
cattle
to
interbreed
with
other
closely
related
species.
Hybrid
individuals
and
even
breeds
exist,
not
only
between
taurine
cattle
and
zebu
(such
as
the
sanga
cattle,
Bos
taurus
africanus),
but
also
between
one
or
both
of
these
and
some
other
members
of
the
genus
Bos –
yaks
(the
dzo
or
yattle[6]),
banteng,
and
gaur.
Hybrids
such
as
the
beefalo
breed
can
even
occur
between
taurine
cattle
and
either
species
of
bison,
leading
some
authors
to
consider
them
part
of
the
genus
Bos,
as
well.[7]
The
hybrid
origin
of
some
types
may
not
be
obvious
for
example,
genetic
testing
of
the
Dwarf
Lulu
breed,
the
only
taurine
type
cattle
in
Nepal,
found
them
to
be
a
mix
of
taurine
cattle,
zebu,
and
yak.[8]
However,
cattle
cannot
successfully
be
hybridized
with
more
distantly
related
bovines
such
as
water
buffalo
or
African
buffalo.
The
aurochs
originally
ranged
throughout
Europe,
North
Africa,
and
much
of
Asia.
In
historical
times,
its
range
became
restricted
to
Europe,
and
the
last
known
individual
died
in
Masovia,
Poland,

about
Breeders
have
attempted
to
recreate
cattle
of
similar
appearance
to
aurochs
by
crossing
traditional
types
of
domesticated
cattle,
creating
the
Heck
cattle
breed.

In
general,
the
same
words
are
used
in
different
parts
of
the
world,
but
with
minor
differences
in
the
definitions.
The
terminology
described
here
contrasts
the
differences
in
definition
between
the
United
Kingdom
and
other
British
influenced
parts
of
world
such
as
Canada
Australia
New
Zealand,
Ireland
and
the
United
States.[14]
An
"intact"
(i.e.,
not
castrated)
adult
male
is
called
a
bull.
A
wild,
young,
unmarked
bull
is
known
as
a
"micky"
in
Australia.[15]
An
unbranded
bovine
of
either
sex
is
called
a
"maverick"
in
the
USA
and
Canada.
An
adult
female
that
has
had
a
calf
(or
two,
depending
on
regional
usage)
is
a
cow.
A
young
female
before
she
has
had
a
calf
of
her
own[16]
and
is
under
three
years
of
age
is
called
a
heifer.[17]
A
young
female
that
has
had
only
one
calf
is
occasionally
called
a
first
calf
heifer.
Young
cattle
of
both
sexes
are
called
calves
until
they
are
weaned,
then
weaners
until
they
are
a
year
old
in
some
areas;
in
other
areas,
particularly
with
male
beef
cattle,
they
may
be
known
as
feeder
calves
or
simply
feeders.
After
that,
they
are
referred
to
as
yearlings
or
stirks[18]
if
between
one
and
two
years
of
age.[19]
A
castrated
male
is
called
a
steer
in
the
United
States;
older
steers
are
often
called
bullocks
in
other
parts
of
the
world,[20]
but
in
North
America
this
term
refers
to
a
young
bull.
Piker
bullocks
are
micky
bulls
(uncastrated
young
male
bulls)
that
were
caught,
castrated
and
then
later
lost.[15]
In
Australia,
the
term
"Japanese
ox"
is
used
for
grain
fed
steers
in
the
weight
range
of
to
kg
that
are
destined
for
the
Japanese
meat
trade.[21]
In
North
America,
draft
cattle
under
four
years
old
are
called
working
steers.
Improper
or
late
castration
on
a
bull
results
in
it
becoming
a
coarse
steer
known
as
a
stag
in
Australia,
Canada
and
New
Zealand.[22]
In
some
countries,
an
incompletely
castrated
male
is
known
also
as
a
rig.
A
castrated
male
(occasionally
a
female
or
in
some
areas
a
bull)
kept
for
draft
purposes
is
called
an
ox
(plural
oxen);
"ox"
may
also
be
used
to
refer
to
some
carcass
products
from
any
adult
cattle,
such
as
ox
hide,
ox
blood,
oxtail,
or
ox
liver.[17]
A
springer
is
a
cow
or
heifer
close
to
calving.[23]
In
all
cattle
species,
a
female
twin
of
a
bull
usually
becomes
an
infertile
partial
intersex,
and
is
called
a
freemartin.
Neat
(horned
oxen,
from
which
neatsfoot
oil
is
derived),
beef
(young
ox)
and
beefing
(young
animal
fit
for
slaughtering)
are
obsolete
terms,
although
poll,
pollard
or
polled
cattle
are
still
terms
in
use
for
naturally
hornless
animals,
or
in
some
areas
also
for
those
that
have
been
disbudded
or
dehorned.
Cattle
raised
for
human
consumption
are
called
beef
cattle.
Within
the
American
beef
cattle
industry,
the
older
term
beef
(plural
beeves)
is
still
used
to
refer
to
an
animal
of
either
sex.
Some
Australian,
Canadian,
New
Zealand
and
British
people
use
the
term
beast,
especially
for
single
animals
when
the
sex
is
unknown.[24]
Cattle
bred
specifically
for
milk
production
are
called
milking
or
dairy
cattle;[14]
a
cow
kept
to
provide
milk
for
one
family
may
be
called
a
house
cow
or
milker.
A
"fresh
cow"
is
a
dairy
term
for
a
cow
or
first
calf
heifer
who
has
recently
given
birth,
or
"freshened."
The
adjective
applying
to
cattle
in
general
is
usually
bovine.
The
terms
"bull",
"cow"
and
"calf"
are
also
used
by
extension
to
denote
the
sex
or
age
of
other
large
animals,
including
whales,
hippopotamuses,
camels,
elk
and
elephants.

Singular
terminology
issue
Cattle
can
only
be
used
in
the
plural
and
not
in
the
singular:
it
is
a
plurale
tantum.[25]
Thus
one
may
refer
to
"three
cattle"
or
"some
cattle",
but
not
"one
cattle".
No
universally
used
singular
form
in
modern
English
of
"cattle"
exists,
other
than
the
sex

and
age
specific
terms
such
as
cow,
bull,
steer
and
heifer.
Historically,
"ox"
was
not
a
sex
specific
term
for
adult
cattle,
but
generally
this
is
now
used
only
for
draft
cattle,
especially
adult
castrated
males.
The
term
is
also
incorporated
into
the
names
of
other
species,
such
as
the
musk
ox
and
"grunting
ox"
(yak),
and
is
used
in
some
areas
to
describe
certain
cattle
products
such
as
ox
hide
and
oxtail.[26]
A
Brahman

"Cow"
is
in
general
use
as
a
singular
for
the
collective
"cattle",
despite
the
objections
by
those
who
insist
it
to
be
a
female
specific
term.
Although
the
phrase
"that
cow
is
a
bull"
is
absurd
from
a
lexicographic
standpoint,
the
word
"cow"
is
easy
to
use
when
a
singular
is
needed
and
the
sex
is
unknown
or
irrelevant
when
"there
is
a
cow
in
the
road",
for
example.
Further,
any
herd
of
fully
mature
cattle
in
or
near
a
pasture
is
statistically
likely
to
consist
mostly
of
cows,
so
the
term
is
probably
accurate
even
in
the
restrictive
sense.
Other
than
the
few
bulls
needed
for
breeding,
the
vast
majority
of
male
cattle
are
castrated
as
calves
and
slaughtered
for
meat
before
the
age
of
three
years.
Thus,
in
a
pastured
herd,
any
calves
or
herd
bulls
usually
are
clearly
distinguishable
from
the
cows
due
to
distinctively
different
sizes
and
clear
anatomical
differences.
Merriam
Webster,
a
US
dictionary,
recognizes
the
sex
nonspecific
use
of
"cow"
as
an
alternate
definition,[27]
whereas
Collins,
a
UK
dictionary,
does
not.
Colloquially,
more
general
nonspecific
terms
may
denote
cattle
when
a
singular
form
is
needed.
Australian,
New
Zealand
and
British
farmers
use
the
term
"beast"
or
"cattle
beast".
"Bovine"
is
also
used
in
Britain.
The
term
"critter"
is
common
in
the
western
United
States
and
Canada,
particularly
when
referring
to
young
cattle.[28]
In
some
areas
of
the
American
South
(particularly
the
Appalachian
region),
where
both
dairy
and
beef
cattle
are
present,
an
individual
animal
was
once
called
a
"beef
critter",
though
that
term
is
becoming
archaic.

Cattle
are
large
quadrupedal
ungulate
mammals
with
cloven
hooves.
Most
breeds
have
horns,
which
can
be
as
large
as
the
Texas
Longhorn
or
small
like
a
scur.
Careful
genetic
selection
has
allowed
polled
(hornless)
cattle
to
become
widespread.
Cattle
are
ruminants,
meaning
their
digestive
system
is
highly
specialized
to
allow
the
use
of
poorly
digestible
plants
as
food.
Cattle
have
one
stomach
with
four
compartments,
the
rumen,
reticulum,
omasum,
and
abomasum,
with
the
rumen
being
the
largest
compartment.
Cattle
are
known
for
regurgitating
and
re
chewing
their
food,
known
as
"cud"
chewing.
The
reticulum,
the
smallest
compartment,
is
known
as
the
"honeycomb".
Cattle
sometimes
consume
metal
objects
which
are
deposited
in
the
reticulum
and
irritation
from
the
metal
objects
causes
hardware
disease.
The
omasum's
main
function
is
to
absorb
water
and
nutrients
from
the
digestible
feed.
The
omasum
is
known
as
the
"many
plies".
The
abomasum
is
like
the
human
stomach;
this
is
why
it
is
known
as
the
"true
stomach".
The
cud
is
then
reswallowed
and
further
digested
by
specialized
microorganisms
in
the
rumen.
These
microbes
are
primarily
responsible
for
decomposing
cellulose
and
other
carbohydrates
into
volatile
fatty
acids
cattle
use
as
their
primary
metabolic
fuel.
The
microbes
inside
the
rumen
also
synthesize
amino
acids
from
non
protein
nitrogenous
sources,
such
as
urea
and
ammonia.
As
these
microbes
reproduce
in
the
rumen,
older
generations
die
and
their
cells
continue
on
through
the
digestive
tract.
These
cells
are
then
partially
digested
in
the
small
intestines,
allowing
cattle
to
gain
a
high
quality
protein
source.
These
features
allow
cattle
to
thrive
on
grasses
and
other
vegetation.

A
common
misconception
about
cattle
(particularly
bulls)
is
that
they
are
enraged
by
the
color
red
(something
provocative

often
said
to
be
"like
a
red
flag
to
a
bull").
This
is
incorrect,
as
cattle
are
red
green

blind
The
myth
arose
from
the
use
of
red
capes
in
bullfighting;
in
fact,
two
different
capes
are
used.
The
capote
is
a
large,
flowing,
magenta
and
yellow
cape.
The
more
famous
muleta
is
the
smaller,
red
cape,
used
exclusively
for
the
final,
fatal
segment
of
the
fight.
It
is
not
the
color
of
the
cape
that
angers
the
bull,
but
rather
the
movement
of
the
fabric
that
irritates
the
bull
and
incites
it
to
charge.

of
Agriculture
reported
having
mapped
the
bovine
genome.[43]
The
scientists
found
cattle
have
about
genes,
and
of
their
genes
are
shared
with
humans,
and
they
share
about
genes
with
dogs
and
rodents,
but
are
not
found
in
humans.
Using
this
bovine
"HapMap",
researchers
can
track
the
differences
between
the
breeds
that
affect
the
quality
of
meat
and
milk
yields.[44]

Cattle
occupy
a
unique
role
in
human
history,
domesticated
since
at
least
the
early
Neolithic.
Geneticists
and
anthropologists
used
to
suspect
that,
years
ago,
Africans
domesticated
local
cattle.
A
study
was
done
by
University
of
Missouri
researchers
reported
that
ancient
domesticated
African
cattle
originated
from
multiple
regions,
in
the
middle
east
and
India.[45]
A
study
on
breeds
showed
that
today's
cattle
originates
from
Africa,
Asia,
North
and
South
America,
Australia,
and
Europe.[46]
According
to
McTavish
et
some
researchers
have
suggested
that
African
taurine
cattle
are
derived
from
a
third
independent
domestication
from
North
African
aurochsen.[47]
Other
modern
genetic
research
suggests
the
entire
modern
domestic
stock
may
have
arisen
from
as
few
as
80
aurochs
tamed
in
the
upper
reaches
of
Mesopotamia
about
years
ago
near
the
villages
of
Çayönü
Tepesi
in
southeastern
Turkey
and
Dja'de
el
Mughara
in
northern
Iraq.[2]
They
are
raised
for
meat
(beef
cattle),
dairy
products
and
hides.
They
are
also
used
as
draft
animals
and
in
certain
sports.
Some
consider
cattle
the
oldest
form
of
wealth,
and
cattle
raiding
consequently
one
of
the
earliest
forms
of
theft.
This

often
restrained
or

when
given

attention.
This
young
bovine
has
a
nose
ring
to
prevent
it
from

which
is
usually
to
assist
in

Cattle
are
often
raised
by
allowing
herds
to
graze
on
the
grasses
of
large
tracts
of
rangeland.
Raising
cattle
in
this
manner
allows
the
use
of
land
that
might
be
unsuitable
for
growing
crops.
The
most
common
interactions
with
cattle
involve
daily
feeding,
cleaning
and
milking.
Many
routine
husbandry
practices
involve
ear
tagging,
dehorning,
loading,
medical
operations,
vaccinations
and
hoof
care,
as
well
as
training
for
agricultural
shows
and
preparations.
Also,
some
cultural
differences
occur
in
working
with
cattle;
the
cattle
husbandry
of
Fulani
men
rests
on
behavioural
techniques,
whereas
in
Europe,
cattle
are
controlled
primarily
by
physical
means,
such
as
fences.[48]
Breeders
use
cattle
husbandry
to
reduce
infection
susceptibility
by
selective
breeding
and
maintaining
herd
health
to
avoid
concurrent
disease.[49]
Cattle
are
farmed
for
beef,
veal,
dairy,
and
leather,
and
they
are
less
commonly
used
for
conservation
grazing,
simply
to
maintain
grassland
for
wildlife
for
example,
in
Epping
Forest,
England.
They
are
often
used
in
some
of
the
most
wild
places
for
livestock.
Depending
on
the
breed,
cattle
can
survive
on
hill
grazing,
heaths,
marshes,
moors
and
semidesert.
Modern
cattle
are
more
commercial
than
older
breeds
and,
having
become
more
specialized,
are
less
versatile.
For
this
reason,
many
smaller
farmers
still
favor
old
breeds,
such
as
the
Jersey
dairy
breed.
In
Portugal,
Spain,
southern
France
and
some
Latin
American
countries,
bulls
are
used
in
the
activity
of
bullfighting;
Jallikattu
in
India
is
a
bull
taming
sport
radically
different
from
European
bullfighting,
humans
are
unarmed
and
bulls
are
not
killed.
In
many
other
countries
bullfighting
is
illegal.
Other
activities
such
as
bull
riding
are
seen
as
part
of
a
rodeo,
especially
in
North
America.
Bull
leaping,
a
central
ritual
in
Bronze
Age
Minoan
culture
(see
Bull
(mythology)),
still
exists
in
southwestern
France.
In
modern
times,
cattle
are
also
entered
into
agricultural
competitions.
These
competitions
can
involve
live
cattle
or
cattle
carcases
in
hoof
and
hook
events.
In
terms
of
food
intake
by
humans,
consumption
of
cattle
is
less
efficient
than
of
grain
or
vegetables
with
regard
to
land
use,
and
hence
cattle
grazing
consumes
more
area
than
such
other
agricultural
production
when
raised
on
grains.[50]
Nonetheless,
cattle
and
other
forms
of
domesticated
animals
can
sometimes
help
to
use
plant
resources
in
areas
not
easily
amenable
to
other
forms
of
agriculture.

Economy
Holstein
cattle
are
the
primary
dairy
breed,
bred
for
high
milk
production.
The
meat
of
adult
cattle
is
known
as
beef,
and
that
of
calves
is
veal.
Other
animal
parts
are
also
used
as
food
products,
including
blood,
liver,
kidney,
heart
and
oxtail.
Cattle
also
produce
milk,
and
dairy
cattle
are
specifically
bred
to
produce
the
large
quantities
of
milk
processed
and
sold
for
human
consumption.
Cattle
today
are
the
basis
of
a
multi
billion
dollar
industry
worldwide.
The
international
trade
in
beef
for
was
over
billion
and
represented
only
of
world
beef
production.[52]
The
production
of
milk,
which
is
also
made
into
cheese,
butter,
yogurt,
and
other
dairy
products,
is
comparable
in
economic
size
to
beef
production,
and
provides
an
important
part
of
the
food
supply
for
many
of
the
world's
people.
Cattle
hides,
used
for
leather
to
make
shoes,
couches
and
clothing,
are
another
widespread
product.
Cattle
remain
broadly
used
as
draft
animals
in
many
developing
countries,
such
as
India.

County,

A
report
from
the
Food
and
Agriculture
Organization
(FAO)
states
that
the
livestock
sector
is
"responsible
for
18%
of
greenhouse
gas
emissions".[56]
The
report
concludes,
unless
changes
are
made,
the
damage
thought
to
be
linked
to
livestock
may
more
than
double
by
2050,
as
demand
for
meat
increases.
Another
concern
is
manure,
which
if
not
well
managed,
can
lead
to
adverse
environmental
consequences.
However,
manure
also
is
a
valuable
source
of
nutrients
and
organic
matter
when
used
as
a
fertilizer.[57]
Manure
was
used
as
a
fertilizer
on
about
15.8
million
acres
of
US
cropland
in
2006,
with
manure
from
cattle
accounting
for
nearly
70%
of
manure
applications
to
soybeans
and
about
80%
or
more
of
manure
applications
to
corn,
wheat,
barley,
oats
and
sorghum.[58]
Substitution
of
manure
for
synthetic
fertilizers
in
crop
production
can
be
environmentally
significant,
as
between
43
and
88
megajoules
of
fossil
fuel
energy
would
be
used
per
kg
of
nitrogen
in
manufacture
of
synthetic
nitrogenous
fertilizers.[59]

One
of
the
cited
changes
suggested
to
reduce
greenhouse
gas
emissions
is
intensification
of
the
livestock
industry,
since
intensification
leads
to
less
land
for
a
given
level
of
production.
This
assertion
is
supported
by
studies
of
the
US
beef
production
system,
suggesting
practices
prevailing
in
2007
involved
8.6%
less
fossil
fuel
use,
16.3%
less
greenhouse
gas
emissions,
12.1%
less
water
use,
and
33.0%
less
land
use,
per
unit
mass
of
beef
produced,
than
those
used
in
1977.[60]
However,
these
numbers
included
not
only
feedlots,
but
also
feed
production,
forage
based
cow
calf
operations,
backgrounding
before
cattle
enter
a
feedlot,
and
animals
culled
from
the
dairy
industry.[61]

The
number
of
American
cattle
kept
in
confined
feedlot
conditions
fluctuates.
From
1
January
2002
through
1
January
2012,
there
was
no
significant
overall
upward
or
downward
trend
in
the
number
of
US
cattle
on
feed
for
slaughter,
which
averaged
about
14.046
million
head
over
that
period.[62][63]
Previously,
the
number
had
increased;
it
was
12.453
million
in
1985.[64]
Cattle
on
feed
(for
slaughter)
numbered
about
14.121
million
on
1
January
2012,
i.e.
about
15.5%
of
the
estimated
inventory
of
90.8
million
US
cattle
(including
calves)
on
that
date.
Of
the
14.121
million,
US
cattle
on
feed
(for
slaughter)
in
operations
with
1000
head
or
more
were
estimated
to
number
11.9
million.[63]
Cattle
feedlots
in
this
size
category
correspond
to
the
regulatory
definition
of
"large"
concentrated
animal
feeding
operations
(CAFOs)
for
cattle
other
than
mature
dairy
cows
or
veal
calves.[65]
Significant
numbers
of
dairy,
as
well
as
beef
cattle,
are
confined
in
CAFOs,
defined
as
"new
and
existing
operations
which
stable
or
confine
and
feed
or
maintain
for
a
total
of
45
days
or
more
in
any
12
month
period
more
than
the
number
of
animals
specified"[66]
where
"[c]rops,
vegetation,
forage
growth,
or
post
harvest
residues
are
not
sustained
in
the
normal
growing
season
over
any
portion
of
the
lot
or
facility."[67]
They
may
be
designated
as
small,
medium
and
large.
Such
designation
of
cattle
CAFOs
is
according
to
cattle
type
(mature
dairy
cows,
veal
calves
or
other)
and
cattle
numbers,
but
medium
CAFOs
are
so
designated
only
if
they
meet
certain
discharge
criteria,
and
small
CAFOs
are
designated
only
on
a
case
by
case
basis.[68]

A
CAFO
that
discharges
pollutants
is
required
to
obtain
a
permit,
which
requires
a
plan
to
manage
nutrient
runoff,
manure,
chemicals,
contaminants,
and
other
wastewater
pursuant
to
the
Clean
Water
Act.[69]
The
regulations
involving
CAFO
permitting
have
been
extensively
litigated.[70]
Commonly,
CAFO
wastewater
and
manure
nutrients
are
applied
to
land
at
agronomic
rates
for
use
by
forages
or
crops,
and
it
is
often
assumed
that
various
constituents
of
wastewater
and
manure,
e.g.
organic
contaminants
and
pathogens,
will
be
retained,
inactivated
or
degraded
on
the
land
with
application
at
such
rates;
however,
additional
evidence
is
needed
to
test
reliability
of
such
assumptions
.[71]
Concerns
raised
by
opponents
of
CAFOs
have
included
risks
of
contaminated
water
due
to
feedlot
runoff,[72]
soil
erosion,
human
and
animal
exposure
to
toxic
chemicals,
development
of
antibiotic
resistant
bacteria
and
an
increase
in
E.
coli
contamination.[73]
While
research
suggests
some
of
these
impacts
can
be
mitigated
by
developing
wastewater
treatment
systems[72]
and
planting
cover
crops
in
larger
setback
zones,[74]
the
Union
of
Concerned
Scientists
released
a
report
in
2008
concluding
that
CAFOs
are
generally
unsustainable
and
externalize
costs.[75]

An
estimated
935,000
cattle
operations
were
operating
in
the
USA
in
2010.[76]
In
2001,
the
US
Environmental
Protection
Agency
(EPA)
tallied
5,990
cattle
CAFOs
then
regulated,
consisting
of
beef
(2,200),
dairy
(3,150),
heifer
(620)
and
veal
operations
(20).[77]
Since
that
time,
the
EPA
has
established
CAFOs
as
an
enforcement
priority.
EPA
enforcement
highlights
for
fiscal
year
2010
indicated
enforcement
actions
against
12
cattle
CAFOs
for
violations
that
included
failures
to
obtain
a
permit,
failures
to
meet
the
terms
of
a
permit,
and
discharges
of
contaminated
water.[78]

Slovenia
Grazing
by
cattle
at
low
intensities
can
create
a
favourable
environment
for
native
herbs
and
forbs;
in
many
world
regions,
though,
cattle
are
reducing
biodiversity
due
to
overgrazing.[79]
A
survey
of
refuge
managers
on
123
National

Refuges
in
the
US
tallied
86
species
of
wildlife
considered
positively
affected
and
82
considered
negatively
affected
by
refuge
cattle
grazing
or
haying.[80]
Proper
management
of
pastures,
notably
managed
intensive
rotational
grazing
and
grazing
at
low
intensities
can
lead
to
less
use
of
fossil
fuel
energy,
increased
recapture
of
carbon
dioxide,
fewer
ammonia
emissions
into
the
atmosphere,
reduced
soil
erosion,
better
air
quality,
and
less
water
pollution.[75]

Some
microbes
in
the
cattle
gut
carry
out
anaerobic
process
known
as
methanogenesis,
which
produces
methane.
Cattle
and
other
livestock
emit
about
80
to
93
Tg
of
methane
per
year,[81]
accounting
for
an
estimated
37%
of
anthropogenic
methane
emissions,[56]
and
additional
methane
is
produced
by
anaerobic
fermentation
of
manure
in
manure
lagoons
and
other
manure
storage
structures.[82]
The
100
year
global
warming
potential
of
methane,
including
effects
on
ozone
and
stratospheric
water
vapor,
is
25
times
as
great
as
that
of
carbon
dioxide.[83]
Methane's
effect
on
global
warming
is
correlated
with
changes
in
atmospheric
methane
content,
not
with
emissions.
The
net
change
in
atmospheric
methane
content
was
recently
about
1
Tg
per
year,[84]
and
in
some
recent
years
there
has
been
no
increase
in
atmospheric
methane
content.[85]
Mitigation
options
for
reducing
methane
emission
from
ruminant
enteric
fermentation
include
genetic
selection,
immunization,
rumen
defaunation,
diet
modification
and
grazing
management,
among
others.[86][87][88]
While
cattle
fed
forage
actually
produce
more
methane
than
grain
fed
cattle,
the
increase
may
be
offset
by
the
increased
carbon
recapture
of
pastures,
which
recapture
three
times
the
CO2
of
cropland
used
for
grain.[75]

Health
The
veterinary
discipline
dealing
with
cattle
and
cattle
diseases
(bovine
veterinary)
is
called
buiatrics.[89]
Veterinarians
and
professionals
working
on
cattle
health
issues
are
pooled
in
the
World
Association
for
Buiatrics,
founded
in
1960.[90]
National
associations
and
affiliates
also
exist.[91]

Cattle
diseases
were
in
the
center
of
attention
in
the
1980s
and
1990s
when
the
Bovine
spongiform
encephalopathy
(BSE),
also
known
as
mad
cow
disease,
was
of
concern.
Cattle
might
catch
and
develop
various
other
diseases,
like
blackleg,
bluetongue,
foot
rot
too.[92][93][94]

In
most
state,
as
cattle
health
is
not
only
a
veterinarian
issue,
but
also
a
public
health
issue,
public
health
and
food
safety
standards
and
farming
regulations
directly
affect
the
daily
work
of
farmers
who
keep
cattle.[95]
However,
said
rules
change
frequently
and
are
often
debated.
For
instance,
in
the
U.K.,
it
was
proposed
in
2011
that
milk
from
tubercolosis
infected
cattle
should
be
allowed
to
enter
the
food
chain.[96]
Internal
food
safety
regulations
might
affect
a
country's
trade
policy
as
well.
For
example,
the
United
States
has
just
reviewed
its
beef
import
rules
according
to
the
"mad
cow
standards";
while
Mexico
forbids
the
entry
of
cattle
who
are
older
than
30
months.[97]

Cow
urine
is
commonly
used
in
India
for
internal
medical
purposes.[98][99]
It
is
distilled
and
then
consumed
by
patients
seeking
treatment
for
a
wide
variety
of
illnesses.[100]
At
present,
no
conclusive
medical
evidence
shows
this
has
any
effect.[101]
However,
an
Indian
medicine
containing
cow
urine
has
already
obtained
U.S.
patents.[102]

Digital
dermatitis
is
caused
by
the
bacteria
from
the
genus
Treponema.
Is
it
different
than
foot
rot
and
can
appear
under
unsanitary
conditions
such
as
poor
hygiene,
inadequate
hoof
trimming
among
other
causes.
It
primarily
affects
dairy
cattle
and
has
been
known
to
lower
the
quantity
of
milk
produced,
however
the
milk
quality
remains
unaffected.

Mycobacterium
vaccae
is
a
non
pathogenic,
possibly
even
beneficial
bacteria,
that
is
seen
naturally
in
soil;[103]
that
was
first
isolated
from
cow
dung.[104]


Oxen
Main

Ox

Draft
Zebus
in
Mumbai,
Maharashtra,
India
Oxen
(singular
ox)
are
cattle
trained
as
draft
animals.
Often
they
are
adult,
castrated
males
of
larger
breeds,
although
females
and
bulls
are
also
used
in
some
areas.
Usually,
an
ox
is
over
four
years
old
due
to
the
need
for
training
and
to
allow
it
to
grow
to
full
size.
Oxen
are
used
for
plowing,
transport,
hauling
cargo,
grain

Oxen
used
in
Plowing
An
ox
is
a
mature
bovine
which
has
learned
to
respond
appropriately
to
a
teamster's
signals.
These
signals
are
given
by
verbal
commands
or
by
noise
(whip
cracks).
Verbal
commands
vary
according
to
dialect
and
local
tradition.
In
one
tradition
in
North
America,
the
commands
are:[citation

"Back
up":
go
backwards
"Gee":
turn
right
"Get
up":
walk
forward
"Haw":
turn
left
"Whoa":
stop

Riding
an
ox
in
Hova,

Oxen
can
pull
harder
and
longer
than
horses.
Though
not
as
fast
as
horses,
they
are
less
prone
to
injury
because
they
are
more
sure
footed.

Many
oxen
are
used
worldwide,
especially
in
developing
countries.

the
cow
is
a

of
wealth,
strength,
abundance,
selfless
giving
and
a
full
Earthly

Cattle
are
venerated
within

respect
'as
one's
mother'.[108]
They
appear
in
numerous
stories
from
the
Puranas
and
Vedas.
The

news
story
written

could
serve
three

but
one
year
for
