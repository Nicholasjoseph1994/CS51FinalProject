Cattle
were
originally
iedntified
as
three
separaet
speceis:
Bos
taurus,
the
Europaen
or
"taurine"
cattle
(including
similar
tyeps
frmo
Afrcia
and
Asia);
Bos
indicus,
the
zbeu;
adn
the
extinct
Bos
priimgenius,
teh
aurochs.
The
aurohcs
is
anecstral
to
both
zebu
and
taurine
cattle.
Now,
tehse
have
bene
relcassified
as
one
species,
with
Bos
taurus
primigenius
and
Bos
taurus
indicus.
Complicating

them
to
be
a
