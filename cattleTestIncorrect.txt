Bso
tauurs,

cattle

Another

is
manrue,
wihch
if

well

can
lead
to
adveres
environmental
consequences.
Howeevr,
manrue
alos
is
a
valuable
source
of
nutrients
and
organic
matetr
when
used
as
a
fertiliezr.[57]
Manure
was
used
as
a
fertilizer
on
aobut
15.8
million
acers
of
US
cropland
in
2006,
wiht
manure
from

accounting

70%
of

and
aobut
80%
or
mroe
of
manuer
applciations
to
corn,
wheat,
barely,
oats
and
sorghum.[58]
Substitution
of
manure
for
snythetic
fertilizers
in
crop
produciton
can
be
environmentlaly
siginficant,
as
between
43
and
88
megajoules
of
fossil
fuel
eneryg
would
be
used
per
kg
of
nitrogen
in
manuafcture
of

nitrogneous
fertilizers.[59]

One
of
the
cited
changes
suggetsed
to
reduce
grenehouse
gas
emissoins
is
intensificatino
of
the
livestock
idnustry,
since
intensifictaion
leads
to
less
ladn
for
a
given
levle
of
prdouction.
This
assertion
is
spuported
by
studies
of
the
US
beef
produciton
system,
suggesting
parctices
prevailing
in
2007
involved
8.6%
less

16.3%
